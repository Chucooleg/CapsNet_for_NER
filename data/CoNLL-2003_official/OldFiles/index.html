<h1>Language-Independent Named Entity Recognition (II)</h1>
<p>
Named entities are phrases that contain the names of persons,
organizations, locations, times and quantities.
Example:
<p>
<blockquote>
[ORG <font color="#0000ff">U.N.</font> ]
official
[PER <font color="#ff0000">Ekeus</font> ]
heads
for
[LOC <font color="#00ff00">Baghdad</font> ]
.
</blockquote>
<p>
The shared task of CoNLL-2003 concerns language-independent named
entity recognition.
We will concentrate on four types of named entities: persons,
locations, organizations and names of miscellaneous entities that do
not belong to the previous three groups.
The participants of the shared task will be offered training and test
data for two languages.
They will use the data for developing a named-entity recognition
system that includes a machine learning component.
For each language, additional information (lists of names and 
non-annotated data) will be supplied as well.
The challenge for the participants is to find ways of incorporating 
this information in their system.
<p>
<h2>Background information</h2>
<p>
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of Information Extraction.
Different NER systems were evaluated as a part of the Sixth Message
Understanding Conference in 1995
(<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/grishman/muc6.html">MUC6</a>).
The target language was English.
The participating systems performed well.
However, many of them used language-specific resources for performing
the task and it is unknown how they would have performed on another
language than English [<a href="#PD97">PD97</a>].
<p>
After 1995, NER systems have been developed for some European languages
and a few Asian languages.
There have been at least two studies that have applied one NER system
to different languages.
Palmer and Day [<a href="#PD97">PD97</a>] have used statistical methods
for finding named entities in newswire articles in Chinese, English,
French, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish.
They found that the difficulty of the NER task was different for the
six languages but that a large part of the task could be performed
with simple methods.
Cucerzan and Yarowsky [<a href="#CY99">CY99</a>] used both
morphological and contextual clues for identifying named entities in
English, Greek, Hindi, Rumanian and Turkish.
With minimal supervision, they obtained overall F measures between 40
and 70, depending on the languages used.
In the shared task at
<a href="../../conll2002/ner/">CoNLL-2002</a>,
twelve different learning systems were applied to data in Spanish and 
Dutch.
<p>
<h2>Software and Data</h2>
<p>
The CoNLL-2003 shared task data files contain four columns separated by 
a single space.
Each word has been put on a separate line and there is an empty line
after each sentence.
The first item on each line is a word, the second a part-of-speech (POS)
tag, the third a syntactic chunk tag and the fourth the named entity
tag.
The chunk tags and the named entity tags have the format I-TYPE which
means that the word is inside a phrase of type TYPE.
Only if two phrases of the same type immediately follow each other,
the first word of the second phrase will have tag B-TYPE to show
that it starts a new phrase.
A word with tag O is not part of a phrase.
Here is an example:
<p>
<pre>
   U.N.         NNP  I-NP  I-ORG 
   official     NN   I-NP  O 
   Ekeus        NNP  I-NP  I-PER 
   heads        VBZ  I-VP  O 
   for          IN   I-PP  O 
   Baghdad      NNP  I-NP  I-LOC 
   .            .    O     O 
</pre>
<p>
The data consists of three files per language: one training file and
two test files testa and testb.
The first test file will be used in the development phase for finding
good parameters for the learning system.
The second test file will be used for the final evaluation.
There are data files available for English and German.
The German files contain an extra column (the second) which holds the 
lemma of each word.
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="../ner.tgz">http://cnts.uia.ac.be/conll2003/ner.tgz</a>
<br> The training, development and test data sets for English and German
     as well as evaluation software for this shared task 
     in one gzipped tar file.
     Fetch this file, extract the data files with the command
     <tt>tar zxf ner.tgz</tt> and follow the instructions in
     the file <tt>ner/000README</tt>.
<br> Individual files:
     <a href="000README">README</a>,
     <a href="etc">annotation</a>,
     <a href="lists/">lists</a>,
     <a href="bin/">software</a>
<li> <a href="../eng.raw.tar">http://cnts.uia.ac.be/conll2003/eng.raw.tar</a>
<br> <a href="../deu.raw.tar">http://cnts.uia.ac.be/conll2003/deu.raw.tar</a>
<br> The unannotated data sets for English and German in one tar file
     (<a href="000README">README</a>).
<br> Note: you need the main file 
     <a href="../ner.tgz">ner.tgz</a>
     as well.
     It contains the software for building the data.
<li> <a href="http://cnts.uia.ac.be/conll2000/chunking/output.html">http://cnts.uia.ac.be/conll2000/chunking/output.html</a>
<br> Output example of the evaluation program for this shared task:
     <a href="http://cnts.uia.ac.be/conll2002/ner/bin/conlleval.txt">conlleval</a>.
     The example deals with text chunking, a task which uses the same
     output format as this named entity task.
     The program requires the output of the NER system for each word 
     to be appended to the corresponding line in the test file, 
     with a single space between the line and the output tag.
     Make sure you keep the empty lines in the test file otherwise
     the software may mistakingly regard separate entities as one 
     big entity.
</ul>
<p>
The English data is a collection of news wire articles from the 
<a href="http://about.reuters.com/researchandstandards/corpus/">Reuters
Corpus</a>.
The annotation has been done by people of the University of Antwerp.
Because of copyright reasons we only make available the annotations.
In order to build the complete data sets you will need access to the
Reuters Corpus.
It can be obtained for research purposes without any charge from
<a href="http://about.reuters.com/researchandstandards/corpus/">Reuters</a>.
<p>
The German data is a collection of articles from the Frankfurter 
Rundschau.
The named entities have been annotated by people of the University 
of Antwerp. 
Only the annotations are available here.
In order to build these data sets you need access to the 
ECI Multilingual Text Corpus.
It can be ordered from the
<a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC94T5">
Linguistic Data Consortium</a>
(2003 non-member price: US$ 35.00).
<p>
<h2>Submission guidelines</h2>
<p>
Submit paper of at most four pages describing the learning
approach and your results on the test set by 
March 16, 2003
to  
<a href="mailto:erikt@uia.ua.ac.be">erikt@uia.ua.ac.be</a> .
Your results should at least contain overall F-rates and F-rates for
the four entity categories (PER, ORG, LOC and MISC) as generated by
the evaluation software for the English test set.
<p>
If you have used other resources than the training data (lists of
named entities, non-annotated data or others) then please also 
include in your paper the performance of your system while 
using the training data only.
In this way we can measure the benefit of using the additional
resources while at the same time make a fair comparison between the
different learning systems.
